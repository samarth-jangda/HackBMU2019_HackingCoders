# Ideas On Theme Of HealthCare

***Analysis System***: -The analysis system consists of a dataset for all hospitals in India which helps in finding ways to decrease the increase of major diseases in the future and hence decreasing the graph of increasing deaths. This Data Set is made in python.

We have created a chat-bot to help persons and it does the following things:

The team has decided to use AOG(Actions On Google/Google Assistant) because it can be easily accessed and can be found in every smartphone. The app will be a multilanguage chatbot on AOG platform which speaks multi languages as per user needs.

a) ***Free Health Camps***: - It provides information to people about the nearby health camps in their area. So that they can locate them on the map and reach easily and get their checkup done.

b) ***Prediction System***: - With the help of Data Inputs of general health check-up from User, the chat-bot will be able to tell the diseases the user is prone to. In Addition, it will help the user to achieve a particular health target(such as improving BMI, better BP, etc) by suggesting minimum Fitness Exercises at times the user can do on daily basis and Raw-Ingredients Intake(proteins, carbohydrates, etc) by suggesting diet plan of foods the user is willing to take. This way it will be able to help people stay healthy & fit in their busy schedule and reducing the diseases they can be affected with, in the coming future.

c) ***Request For blood***: - Suppose a person is in immediate need of blood and in the hospital no blood is found then our app will immediately connect them to blood donors from where they can get blood.

d) ***Instant Remedy***:- Suppose a person has a heart attack so the other person near him can immediately ask our chatbot "what to do during heart attack". Our chatbot would guide him step by step so that he can save the life of a person.

e) Appointment Booking***:- You can easily book your appointment by saying "book my appointment" and mentioning date and time.

f) You can find nearest government-run nutrition centers. The chatbot provides real-time information about the capacity and bed availability as well as contact and direction.

g) Search Best Hospitals And Doctors near you. By entering the pin code you can find the nearest best doctor and hospitals.

h) Ask for healthy food. You can select the particular meal(breakfast, dinner, snacks, etc.), food preference(veg or non-veg) and chatbot gives you suggestions for food

i) You can tell the chatbot about your symptoms and it gives you the best diagnostic. Also, it suggests your medicines and their dosage.
